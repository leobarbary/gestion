Machines are atomic, context-free bits of code which conform to the [machine specification](http://node-machine.org/spec/machine): an open standard for functions and subroutines.\n\n> **Chances are you don't need to use this module directly**- see [About This Module](https://github.com/node-machine/machine#about-this-module) below for info.\n\n\n## Installation &nbsp;  [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/machine.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/machine)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/node-machine/machine.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/node-machine/machine)\n\n**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://sailsjs.com/get-started):**\n```sh\n# Get the machine runner\n$ npm install machine --save\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the machine specification, please request to join the project's [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/node-machine) and introduce yourself to the rest of the core team.  In the mean time, you can check out the tests for information on how to use all the lower-level features of this module.  There is also a guide for direct usage of this module in [`docs/DIRECT_USAGE.md`](./docs/DIRECT_USAGE.md).  Note that you can run the tests for this module using `npm test`.  To re-generate the recursive dependency report (via the `licensing` module by 3rdEden), run `npm run licensing`.\n\n## Issue Submission\nMake sure you've read the [issue submission guidelines](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#opening-issues) from Sails before opening a new issue - the node-machine project uses the same rules.\n\nClick [here](https://github.com/node-machine/machine/search?q=&type=Issues) to search/post issues in this repository.\n\n\n## About this module\n\nBefore you read any further, let's stop and make sure you're in the right place.  The documentation in this README file is for low-level usage of `machine`, the JavaScript machine runner.  You don't need to use this module directly unless you're **building machines**.\n\nYou can find more information about the node-machine project on http://node-machine.org.  There you'll also find a short video from the introductory talk at [dotjs.eu](http://dotjs.eu/), an up-to-date list of all available machines on NPM, and standardized documentation pages with code examples you can copy and paste into your Node.js app (e.g. [Github.createRepo()](http://node-machine.org/machinepack-github/create-repo)).\n\nBuilding a machinepack?  Here are some tips:\n+ Start with [tutorial for implementors](http://node-machine.org/implementing/Getting-Started)\n+ Join the [newsgroup for the machine specification](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/node-machine) to get help from other machine implementors\n+ Don't forget to add the `\"repository\"` key to your package.json file so folks can find your source code (this enables the `View Source` button in the generated documentation on node-machine.org)\n+ Hit up [@mikermcneil](https://twitter.com/mikermcneil) on Twitter and let me know what you're working on!\n\n\n### OK what is this? How does it work?\n\nThis is a low-level module for building, configuring, and running machines.\n\nNormal users of machines won't interact with this module directly very often-- however it _is_ a dependency of every machinepack.  Its full list of responsibilities includes exposing the conventional machine usage, a `.exec()` helper (for familiarity with Waterline), as well as validating input expectations, coercing return values from exits, and more.\n\nThe `.build()` method accepts a machine definition object and returns a new ready-to-use machine instance function.  The `.pack()` method accepts a filesystem path and returns a ready-to-use machinepack obtained by requiring the module located at the path, loading its machine definitions into live machines (calling `.build()` on each definition), and validating that everything is up to spec.\n\nSo when you require a machinepack from NPM like so:\n\n```javascript\nvar Github = require('machinepack-github');\n```\n\nwhat's actually happening is that the `index.js` file in the machinepack module is calling `.pack()` and returning an object of ready-to-go machine instances.\n\n\n\n### Where would I use this module directly?\n\nThere are only two use-cases for requiring this module directly:\n\n##### 1. Your machinepack's boilerplate `index.js` file\n\n> Note that this is taken care of for you if you used the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/node-machine/generator-machinepack) to create your machinepack.\n\nIf you're implementing a machinepack, you'll need to use this module to `.pack()` your machines in your `index.js` file.  Here's an [example of an `index.js` file](https://github.com/mikermcneil/machinepack-urls/blob/master/index.js#L2) (this example happens to come from machinepack-urls- your pack's `index.js` file should always look the same, no matter what).\n\n##### 2. A machine which uses another machine from the same pack\n\nNormally, if you want to use a machine _from inside of one of your machines_, you just install and require the other machinepack in _your_ pack and use it just like you would in app-level code.  But if you want to use another machine in the _same pack_, or you want the machine to call itself recursively, you should use this module directly.  You can read more information on this in the [FAQ for implementors](https://github.com/node-machine/docs/blob/master/creating-a-machinepack/FAQ.md).\n\n### Can I use this module outside of a machinepack?\n\nYou can use it anywhere you like!  For instance, you might want to implement a one-off machine in your app, perhaps to take advantage of caching or type-checking this module provides.\n\n> If you're using Sails, check out [`sails-hook-machines`](https://github.com/node-machine/sails-hook-machines), a hook which allows you to use custom closed-source machines in your Sails app by dropping files into the `api/machines/` folder.\n\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n&copy; 2014 Mike McNeil; &copy; 2015-2017 The Sails Company\n\nLike the [Sails framework](http://sailsjs.com), [this package](http://npmjs.com/package/machine) is available under the **MIT license**.\n\n![image_squidhome@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/RIvu9.png)\n\n\n",
