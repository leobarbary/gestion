  "readme": "# sockets\n\n`sockets` hook for Sails v0.11\n\n## Status\n\n> ##### Stability: [2](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/stability-index.md) - Stable\n\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis hook's responsibilities are:\n\n#### When initialized...\n+ fire up socket.io server\n+ listen for connect / disconnect events\n  + listen for get/post/put/delete/patch events\n    + create bare-bones request and response contexts, then pass them to the core interpreter in Sails to be routed on the fly.\n\n#### Bind \"shadow\" routes...\n\n###### `before`\nN/A\n\n###### `after`\n\n+ `GET __getcookie`\n\n\n#### Expose on the `sails` app object:\n\n+ `sails.sockets.*` (see reference documentationÂ for sails.sockets on sailsjs.org for full list of exposed methods)\n\n## FAQ\n\n> If you have a question that isn't covered here, please feel free to send a PR adding it to this section.\n\n#### What is this?\n\nThis repo contains a hook, one of the building blocks Sails is made out of.\n\n#### What version of Sails is this for?\n\nThis hook is a dependency of Sails core as of v0.11.\n\n#### Does this hook use Socket.io v1.0?\n\nYes.\n\n#### Are there changes?\n\nYes, see the [v0.11 migration guide](http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Upgrading). You probably won't need to change anything unless you were extensively using the old Socket.io v0.9 configuration.\n\n\n## Running the tests\n\nFirst, clone this repo, cd into it, and install dependencies:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets.git\ncd sails-hook-sockets\nnpm install\n```\n\n#### Run them all\n\nTo run all the tests, start a local redis server on port 6380 and then run the tests using mocha:\n\n```sh\nredis-server --port 6380\nnpm test\n```\n\n\n#### Run only certain tests\n\nAlternatively, you can run a particular set of tests with:\n\n```sh\nnode ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g 'without session'\n```\n\n> (this may be useful if you don't want to wait for all the tests to run, or e.g. if you aren't able to install a redis server locally.  However please make sure all the tests pass before submitting a PR.)\n\n\n\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
