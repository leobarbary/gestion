  "readme": "# sails.io.js-dist\n\nThis is the JavaScript SDK for communicating with Sails via sockets.  Specifically, it is the distribution for web browsers, and the release that is bundled in new Sails apps by default.\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nBefore using this package directly, be sure that you're using the same version as the dependency in your version of Sails's [sails-generate](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-generate)'s package.json file.\n\n> Prior to Sails v1, instead of `sails-generate`, this was in the `sails-generate-sails.io.js` dependency,\n> which was itself a dependency of `sails-generate-frontend`, which was itself a depenency of `sails-generate`,\n> which was itself a dependency of `sails.  (You can see why we changed it!)\n>\n> Anyway, if you're using <=Sails v0.12, check the dependency version in the package.json file of [sails-generate-sails.io.js](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-generate-sails.io.js).\n\n\nThis package is _always_ released under the same version string as [`sails.io.js`](https://npmjs.com/package/sails.io.js), the Node.js distribution.  (It is published automatically when `sails.io.js` is published.)\n\n\n## Help\n\nIf you have questions or are having trouble, click [here](http://sailsjs.com/support).\n\n\n## Bugs &nbsp; [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails.io.js-dist.svg)](http://npmjs.com/package/sails.io.js-dist)\n\nTo report a bug, [click here](http://sailsjs.com/bugs).\n\n\n## Contributing &nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails.io.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails.io.js)\n\nPlease observe the guidelines and conventions laid out in the [Sails project contribution guide](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing) when opening issues or submitting pull requests.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/sails.io.js-dist.png?downloads=true)](http://npmjs.com/package/sails.io.js-dist)\n\n\n## License\n\nThis package is part of the [Sails framework](http://sailsjs.com), and is free and open-source under the [MIT License](http://sailsjs.com/license).\n\n\n![image_squidhome@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/RIvu9.png)\n",
